### IMDB Ratings: A primer 
INSERT some details about the dataset 




### The Data

```{r , echo= FALSE , warning = FALSE}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("content/blogs/data", "movies.csv"))
#Creating the data table for the graph

```

Here is the dataset we will be working with. We can use `glimpse` to get a brief overview of the data.
```{r}
#contents of the movies dataset 
glimpse(movies)
```

As we can see the `movies` is a tibble with 2,961 rows and 11 columnswhere each row refers to a specific movie, and the comluns contain more information about the movie including:
<ul>
* `duration` is the duration of the movie in minutes 
* `gross` is the box office gross of the movies in US$
* `votes` is the number of people voted 
* `reviews` is the number of reviews submitted for the movie
* `rating` is the average rating of the movie between 0 and 10 
* `cast_facebook_likes` is the number of facebook likes of movie
</ul>


### Box office Gross- What makes a high grossing movie?

In our dataset we have over 2,961 movies with box office gross ranging from  `r max(movies$gross)` USD to `r min(movies$gross)` USD. Let's try to understand, from the datal, we traits to high grossing movies share. 
First lets look at the distribution of the gross. 

```{r}
options(scipen  = 999)
movies %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(gross), fill = 'white' , size = 1.3) +
  labs(x = 'Box Office Gross USD',
       y = 'Count',
       title = 'Most moviees are average!' ,
       subtitle = 'Distribution of Box Office Gross') +
  scale_colour_solarized("blue")+
  theme(
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = '#2B304A',),
        axis.title = element_text(color = '#C7C8CF' , face = 'bold'), 
        axis.text =  element_text(color = '#C7C8CF' , face = 'bold') ,
        panel.grid = element_blank() ,
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(color = '#C7C8CF' , face = 'bold'),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = '#C7C8CF' , face = 'bold'),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#2B304A', color = '#2B304A') 
        
        )
```


Everyone has their own favorite genre of movie and debate In our dataset we have `r length(unique(movies$genre))` genres,

```{r}
#list the gneres in
```
