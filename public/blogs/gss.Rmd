## The Data 

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.
I will analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but I will only focus on a few of these variables.
```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv("data/smallgss2016.csv", 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
```



The responses including "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer" were excluded from the analysis.

I will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained




## Instagram and Snapchat users by Gender 

Below we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016. 

The formula for the population proprtion is as follows: 

*Proportion = (Snapchat or Instagram users / Total Population)x100*

Firstly , I will the data and removing the NA values to calculate the total Snapchat and Instagram users in 2016 (ie. Total Population). We found the population to total to 1372 people.


```{r, defining_theme , echo = FALSE}
theme_cust <-  theme(
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = '#2B304A', colour ='#2B304A' ),
        axis.title = element_text(color = '#C7C8CF' , face = 'bold' ), 
        axis.text =  element_text(color = '#C7C8CF' , face = 'bold') ,
        panel.grid = element_blank() ,
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(color = '#C7C8CF' , face = 'bold'),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = '#C7C8CF' , face = 'bold'),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#2B304A', color = '#2B304A') ,
        axis.ticks = element_line(color = '#C7C8CF'),
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = '#2B304A'),
        legend.key = element_rect(fill= '#2B304A'),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.text =  element_text(color = '#C7C8CF' , face = 'bold'),

        legend.title =  element_text(color = '#C7C8CF' , face = 'bold'),
        axis.line = element_line(color = '#C7C8CF' )
        
        )
```

```{r NA values}

# Proportion = (Snapchat or Instagram users / Population)*100 - To identify the real value for "Population" in the equation, we need to filter out people with NA for both of these social platforms

gss <- gss %>% 
  #Counting people that should be excluded from the population 
  mutate(no_insta_snap = ifelse(instagrm == "NA" | snapchat == "NA", "Remove", "Keep"))

#Calculating the number of people who answerd yes or no
filtered_tot_pop <- gss %>%
  count(no_insta_snap == "Keep")
filtered_tot_pop <- filtered_tot_pop[2,2]

```



With a known population of `r filtered_tot_pop` size I will proceed to calculate the proportion of users amongst both females and males and also calculate confidence intervals for both.

```{r genders_sn_ig}

#Creating a new column based on the whether people used snapchat or instagram 
#column named snap_insta 

gss <- gss %>% 
  mutate(snap_insta = ifelse(instagrm == "Yes" | snapchat == "Yes", "Yes", "No"))


#calculating the proportion of male and female snap and instagram users 
gender_split <- gss %>%
  filter(no_insta_snap == "Keep") %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(total = count(sex), users = count(snap_insta == "Yes"), proportio = round(users/total*100,2))

#calculating standard error
# and confidence level in new columns 
library(kableExtra)
gender_split <- gender_split %>%
  mutate(std_error = round(sqrt(proportio*(100-proportio)/total),2)) %>%
  # 95% confidence interval calculation (z score of 2)
  mutate(upper_level = round(proportio + 2*std_error,2) ,
         lower_level = round(proportio - 2*std_error ,2))

gender_split%>%
  rename('Gender' = 'sex' ,  'Proportion'  = 'proportio',
         'Lower Level'  = 'lower_level','Upper Level' = 'upper_level' ,
         'Standard Error' = 'std_error' ,  'Total' = 'total',  'Number of Users' = 'users' )%>%
  kbl(caption = "More women use social media than men")%>%
  kable_styling()
 
```


```{r}
  gender_split %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = proportio)) + 
  #plottting error bars 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax  = `upper_level`,
                   ymin  = `lower_level`,
                   width = 0.1,
                   color = sex,
                   ),size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 5, aes(color = sex)) + 
  theme_cust + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
  labs(x = 'Gender' ,
       y = 'Proportion using snapchat or instagram\n',
       title = 'Females more likely to use snapchat and instagram'  )
 
  
```
From the confidence intervals we see that females are more likely to use snapchat and instagram than men. 


##  Do University Graduates use Twitter?

We first filter the data only for the people that have graduated from University (undergraduate/masters) and calculate the proportion of these that use twitter or not, as well as a 95% confidence interval for our results. 

```{r twitter}
##converting degree to factor 
degree <- gss %>%
  select(degree, twitter) %>%
  #new dataframe with degree column as factor 
  mutate_at(vars(degree), funs(as.factor)) %>%
  #create bachelor_graduate column 
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = ifelse(
    degree == 'Bachelor' | degree == 'Graduate', 'Yes' , 
    ifelse(degree == 'NA' , 'NA' , 'No')
  ))


sum_deg <- degree %>%
  #keep only bachelor_graduate == Yes
  filter(bachelor_graduate == 'Yes')%>%
  #create count columns with total graduate and twitter users
  group_by(twitter) %>%
  filter(twitter != 'NA')%>%
  tally() %>%
  mutate(prop = round(n/sum(n)*100,2)) %>%
  mutate(std_error = round(sqrt(prop*(100-prop)/sum(n)) ,4)) %>%
  mutate(lower_level = prop - 2*std_error , 
         upper_level = prop + 2*std_error )


sum_deg %>%
  rename( 'Proportion'  = 'prop', 'Lower Level'  = 'lower_level','Upper Level' = 'upper_level','Standard Error' = 'std_error', 'Most University graduates do not use Twitter' = 'twitter', 'Count' = 'n') %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```


```{r}
  sum_deg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = twitter, y = prop)) + 
  #plottting error bars 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax  = `upper_level`,
                   ymin  = `lower_level`,
                   width = 0.1,
                   color = twitter,
                   ),size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 5, aes(color = twitter)) + 
  theme_cust + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
  labs(x = 'Use Twitter' ,
       y = 'Proportion [%]',
       title = 'Most University graduates do not use Twitter'  )
 
  
```


As seen from above we found that  these two Confidence Intervals do not overlap and it can be statitically stated that graduates do not use twitter;.

## How much time do people spend on their Email per week?


```{r email}

#create new  variable email
email <- gss %>%
  #select first 2 columns 
  select(1:2)%>%
  
  #remove na
  filter(emailhr != 'NA') %>%
  
  #convert the variable to numeric
  mutate_at(vars(emailhr,emailmin), funs(as.numeric)) %>%
  
  #create new total email time 
  mutate(email_tot = emailhr*60 + emailmin)

#summary statistic
ss_email <- email %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(email_tot), median = median(email_tot)) %>%
  kbl(caption = 'Mean and Median weekly email usage') %>%
    kable_styling()
  
ss_email
```
After filtering the population only to those people that use their email we visualize the distribution of the minutes spent emailing per week. We note both the mean and the median but would like to highlight that the median is a better measure to capture the typical amount of time Americans spend on email weekly because, as shown from the desity below, the data includes outliers (eg. 600 minutes per week). 

``` {r}
#plotting desity for email_usg
email %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = email_tot) ,  ) +
  geom_density(fill = '#F9F871' , color = '#F9F871')+
  #plotting the mean and median with a vertical line on the plot
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(120),linetype="dotted", color="blue", size=1) +
  labs(title = 'Americans spend about 120 minutes per week on their Email' ,
    subtitle = 'Minutes spent on Email per week' ,
    y = 'Density', 
    x = 'Minutes Spent on Email', caption = "Source: General Social Survey") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+ 
  scale_x_log10(expand = c(0,0))+ 
  theme_cust 
```



Finally, I calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly.

```{r}


boot_email <- email %>%
  
  #specify variable
  specify(response = email_tot) %>%
  
  #Generate samples 
  generate(reps = 100 , type = 'bootstrap') %>%
  
  #find the mean 
  calculate(stat = 'mean')

  #find the 95% confidence interval 
    
email_ci <- boot_email %>%
    get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
    
  email_ci%>%
    round(. ,2) %>%
    kbl(caption = 'The 95% bootstrap confidence level')%>%
    kable_styling()
    
```
